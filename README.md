- progressive electronic metaconstruct as product from the unifiable body of
  technology designs 
- industrialized distribution of information is a key body of variables
  distinguishing electro-mechanical smart systems from other products
  such as the Great Wall of China and Ancient Egypt architecture.
- the internet, from 1st world elite/governmental exclusive use to
  its current states, greatly influenced by democratization and mass
  consumption agenda as well as internet subnetting (i.e. regional/national
  digital firewalls) and populist/cultural ignorances.
- normalization of internet use has served the objective of catering
  to more needs (digital media itself or digital media platform as conduit
  for exchange and commerce). The advantages that early internet users had
  consist of greater or better information access and alternative long-distance
  communication. Normalization of internet implies these advantages will also shift,
  according to socio-economic status, to remain in exclusive or controlling rights of the
  "elites". This implication is debatable but should be assumed to be the expectations
  from conservative ruling classes, especially those that proudly speak of the merits
  of authoritarian excess.
- Internet Socialism vs National Assets & Private Wealth Accumulation.
    - Pope Francis' seemingly benevolent political rhetoric, for example, is an
      acknowledgment of the consistent failures in trying to balance merit systems with
      conceptualizations of equality and also, the fiat collective looting under
      "equity" appeals. Merit systems become depressed through institutional mass
      acceptance. Some are skeptical of universally appealling rhetoric, and some
      further confirm their biases by what transpired to them, right there in their hometown
      or nation, under the loose principles encouraged by the "universal".
    - The political actor, Andrew Yang, proposes something called universal basic income,
      which if implemented under twisted presumptions for partial executive command, would
      actually decimate the citizen middle-class to put them in the same scope as
      immigrants. The idea of a classless society is really more of a whimsical belief when
      said idea is tried to put to practice.
