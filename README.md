- progressive electronic metaconstruct as product from the unifiable body of
  technology designs 
- industrialized distribution of information is a key body of variables
  distinguishing electro-mechanical smart systems from other products
  such as the Great Wall of China and Ancient Egypt architecture.
- the internet, from 1st world elite/governmental exclusive use to
  its current states, greatly influenced by democratization and mass
  consumption agenda as well as internet subnetting (i.e. regional/national
  digital firewalls) and populist/cultural ignorances.
- normalization of internet use has served the objective of catering
  to more needs (digital media itself or digital media platform as conduit
  for exchange and commerce). The advantages that early internet users had
  consist of greater or better information access and alternative long-distance
  communication. Normalization of internet implies these advantages will also shift,
  according to socio-economic status, to remain in exclusive or controlling rights of the
  "elites". This implication is debatable but should be assumed to be the expectations
  from conservative ruling classes, especially those that proudly speak of the merits
  of authoritarian excess.
- Internet Socialism vs National Assets & Private Wealth Accumulation.
    - Pope Francis' seemingly benevolent political rhetoric, for example, is an
      acknowledgment of the consistent failures in trying to balance merit systems with
      conceptualizations of equality and also, the fiat collective looting under
      "equity" appeals. Merit systems become depressed through institutional mass
      acceptance. Some are skeptical of universally appealling rhetoric, and some
      further confirm their biases by what transpired to them, right there in their hometown
      or nation, under the loose principles encouraged by the "universal".
    - The political actor, Andrew Yang, proposes something called universal basic income,
      which if implemented under twisted presumptions for partial executive command, would
      actually decimate the citizen middle-class to put them in the same scope as
      newly-arrived immigrants escaping poverty or war. The idea of a classless society
      is actually a whimsical belief when said idea is tried to put to practice. However,
      if the first thing a society wants is gainful change, varying class-based rigidity
      is always the answer to enable individuals to come forward with solutions of different
      light. 
- Old people that form gerontocracies are self-absorbed, stuck in their ideology that
  they formulated during their formative years in the context of their ethno-cultural
  loyalties, and may prove to be the biggest deterrents towards certain technological
  integrations. This is not always the case with old people. But when those that can act
  cannot think for themselves, gerontracies are symptomatic of a conservatively pacified
  populace. Gerontocracies, as well as theocracies, are curious examples of ultra-conservatism
  handling the need to adopt and adapt. 
- The pervasive media and social networking, coupled with declining revenues from Internet
  activity, imply the preservation of societal stratification under developments that would
  otherwise be destabilizing.
- Investitures in the internet is big money. Now that's money! As the internet continues to slow down
  its growth due to its gargantuan but mostly empty size, most of the money will be spent on government
  and corporate investigations and less on investing into anything other.
- It is becoming more and more dangerous to empathize with certain individuals. It is foolish to
  mistake a long piece of red tape for a human being. Even when that red tape dresses up in blue collars,
  blue stars, blue bloods, it's still red tape. Red tape is STEM's marriage rings, and some rings are
  rotten like hell.
- The issue with the internet in the context of human identity: the internet becomes more of a tool for the
  identity than a good teacher or friend. Projects become spottily funded. First, people left the malls and
  super-marts behind for Amazon. And next, they go on their way in their real-world bubbles, carrying around
  smart devices enslaved in AI bubbles. 
- The greater connectivity offered by present and emerging internet technologies carries the paradox of
  resource management, especially for matters of pre-empting social arrangements and elevating mediocrity
  as well as foreignness and fringe persons. The paradox reveals itself at times to individuals, then makes
  them forget so as to preserve their sanity for them to live within today's means.
- Historical sectarianism has always proved to be the greatest impediment to shared enjoyment of social
  and technological changes. The internet has become an indisputable cornerstone of informatic distribution.
  If the internet were a person, it would be psychosocial. It is techno-social, in actuality, and the psychopathy
  and psychology that so many people say is the internet are actually notions, notions from the human mind.
- Aggravated command structure. Multi-faceted I/O mechanisms for the internet allow for the intentions of those
  best positioned to be of higher priorities in long lines of considerations. So command structures of wanted design
  can be normalized in practice, and the aggravation experienced by these proceedings is the excess of continuing to
  attempt optimal state.
