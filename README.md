- progressive electronic metaconstruct as product from the unifiable body of
  technology designs 
- industrialized distribution of information is a key body of variables
  distinguishing electro-mechanical smart systems from other products
  such as the Great Wall of China and Ancient Egypt architecture.
- the internet, from 1st world elite/governmental exclusive use to
  its current states, greatly influenced by democratization and mass
  consumption agenda as well as internet subnetting (i.e. regional/national
  digital firewalls) and populist/cultural ignorances.
- normalization of internet use has served the objective of catering
  to more needs (digital media itself or digital media platform as conduit
  for exchange and commerce). The advantages that early internet users had
  consist of greater or better information access and alternative long-distance
  communication. Normalization of internet implies these advantages will also shift,
  according to socio-economic status, to remain in exclusive or controlling rights of the
  "elites". This implication is debatable but should be assumed to be the expectations
  from conservative ruling classes, especially those that proudly speak of the merits
  of authoritarian excess.
- Internet Socialism vs National Assets & Private Wealth Accumulation.
    - Pope Francis' seemingly benevolent political rhetoric, for example, is an
      acknowledgment of the consistent failures in trying to balance merit systems with
      conceptualizations of equality and also, the fiat collective looting under
      "equity" appeals. Merit systems become depressed through institutional mass
      acceptance. Some are skeptical of universally appealling rhetoric, and some
      further confirm their biases by what transpired to them, right there in their hometown
      or nation, under the loose principles encouraged by the "universal".
    - The political actor, Andrew Yang, proposes something called universal basic income,
      which if implemented under twisted presumptions for partial executive command, would
      actually decimate the citizen middle-class to put them in the same scope as
      newly-arrived immigrants escaping poverty or war. The idea of a classless society
      is actually a whimsical belief when said idea is tried to put to practice. However,
      if the first thing a society wants is gainful change, varying class-based rigidity
      is always the answer to enable individuals to come forward with solutions of different
      light. 
- Old people that form gerontocracies are self-absorbed, stuck in their ideology that
  they formulated during their formative years in the context of their ethno-cultural
  loyalties, and may prove to be the biggest deterrents towards certain technological
  integrations. This is not always the case with old people. But when those that can act
  cannot think for themselves, gerontracies are symptomatic of a conservatively pacified
  populace. Gerontocracies, as well as theocracies, are curious examples of ultra-conservatism
  handling the need to adopt and adapt. 
- The pervasive media and social networking, coupled with declining revenues from Internet
  activity, imply the preservation of societal stratification under developments that would
  otherwise be destabilizing.
- Investitures in the internet is big money. Now that's money! As the internet continues to slow down
  its growth due to its gargantuan but mostly empty size, most of the money will be spent on government
  and corporate investigations and less on investing into anything other.
- It is becoming more and more dangerous to empathize with certain individuals. It is foolish to
  mistake a long piece of red tape for a human being. Even when that red tape dresses up in blue collars,
  blue stars, blue bloods, it's still red tape. Red tape is STEM's marriage rings, and some rings are
  rotten like hell.
- The issue with the internet in the context of human identity: the internet becomes more of a tool for the
  identity than a good teacher or friend. Projects become spottily funded. First, people left the malls and
  super-marts behind for Amazon. And next, they go on their way in their real-world bubbles, carrying around
  smart devices enslaved in AI bubbles. 
- The greater connectivity offered by present and emerging internet technologies carries the paradox of
  resource management, especially for matters of pre-empting social arrangements and elevating mediocrity
  as well as foreignness and fringe persons. The paradox reveals itself at times to individuals, then makes
  them forget so as to preserve their sanity for them to live within today's means.
- Historical sectarianism has always proved to be the greatest impediment to shared enjoyment of social
  and technological changes. The internet has become an indisputable cornerstone of informatic distribution.
  If the internet were a person, it would be psychosocial. It is techno-social, in actuality, and the psychopathy
  and psychology that so many people say is the internet are actually notions, notions from the human mind.
- Aggravated command structure. Multi-faceted I/O mechanisms for the internet allow for the intentions of those
  best positioned to be of higher priorities in long lines of considerations. So command structures of wanted design
  can be normalized in practice, and the aggravation experienced by these proceedings is the excess of continuing to
  attempt optimal state of specific preference.
- Expect politics to continue along the lines of "business as usual" on top of "a lot of change and progress".
- All else being equal, the internet enables owner and leader types to dig their metaphorical claws into people's
  brains and backs at more efficient and higher-performing rates.
- As the industrial rust seeps deeper into Internet 2.0, the echoes of prior calls for change return home from Heaven to live
  in the hearts of human beings in ways so variable that some take the opportunity to portray these forces in mystical and
  mysterious ways.  
- Some people have started color-coding their internet domains to declare their allegiances (i.e. yellow gangs, red hatters, blue
  lights) in what appears to be fair competition on a good day. Everyone knows how days are. Good days and bad days. Waiting for the day.
  Counting the days. So the fair competition could turn epic by the honesty of narrators (white tails and grey mirrors). Onlookers,
  restrained by some type of way, have reacted by sounding the alarm about the growing trend of ultra-multi-nationalism. Some of these
  onlookers have further suggested that the world go back to the original model for transparency: clear or opaque grey. But the outcries
  against this model become about the vitality. 
- The presumptuous arrogance remains metaphorically seared onto the foreheads of some of these peoples, lost in the land before time but
  somehow independently reaching the conclusions of their knowing being better via their internet discoveries.
- People have lives. There is the internet, with all the capital and dollies and "artist" types on display (and in the backroom),
  a 24-hour pony show. Piggybacking schemes (the labor/accreditation alternative scheme to pyramid schemes) should be anticipated,
  based on the statistical realities of able-bodied and able-minded. Expect recurring questions of baseless or fallacious nature to impact
  the lives of certain individuals. Expect advanced persistent threats to show themselves in new ways that are not only for
  educational/intellectual purposes. Obscurantistic culture has re-emerged as the norm in Western media, clearly started as a reactionary
  response to BRICS aggression. 
- The internet is global. Chances are there are still issues for any individual, despite their affluence, that they have to deal with in
  their localities (piracy,narcotics, et cetera).
- Some people are panicking and saying that the breaking point is near with all this technologies. There are reports of "hearing voices", a
  feat of engineering that has already been accomplished (long-range acoustic devices, radio technologies,hearing aids). These mechanisms
  can and have been weaponized, and some people became so broke by tolerating the affliction that they are now contemplating walking up
  to the threat actors to shoot or hack their faces off, a low-tech solution.
- The individual STEM professional is wise to not put faith in particular factions of the American Democratic Party, which is looking a
  little too colorful for there not to be questions about the rain that produced the rainbow. For insurance, take it
  a step further by really turning back to the hogstains claiming all the fields and mansions (the same ones that cannot eat
  pork because they're not cannibals).
- There are a lot of struggling professionals, especially those that are not mass consumption marketers, in the US since
  2008 (debatable). If the questions become too puzzling, just think of Russia-Ukraine (Slavic chemical/digital/arms market) and Chinese
  prostitutization of the free mind and market.
- The offensive nature of man, coupled with women's logical dishonesty, is why there are issues agreeing on what Internet 3.0 should be. A separate
  Russian internet? Check. A separate Chinese internet? Check. An exclusive Catholic internet? Who knows? The technology is there (well, at least the
  capital from blockchain).
- There is no easy way forward. Food supply and distribution cannot be taken for granted, for instance. Futuristic technologies can be difficult to scale
  or may be impractical to use, despite the dedication towards perfecting them. The internet is a zenith of a high-tech ecosystem, and an expensive one
  at that (see data center power usage).
- It's only right to take a strong hard stance on immigration, and this is not only about the equity/equality. Think about how irrational it is to blindly
  let the offshoots from other nations to come "settle in America" (drive out nationals, rule the populace, take the jobs, take the technology). Even if
  there is no megalomania from the heads of households, imagine that some of the nastiest hags (women) do nothing but talk shit to everyone else in the
  household, day in day out. Abusive situations, tolerated for years on end. Foreign military brats, bastard royals, state-sponsored murderers by mouth
  or their own hand; these are the characters let in, and the little ones escaping the sun's hell are the ones that get pushed around. That's how asylum
  laws work. There's always a little scorn, by default, for foreign pride (historically).
